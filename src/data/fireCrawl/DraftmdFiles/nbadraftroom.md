| **1- [2](https://nbadraftroom.com/2026-2nd-round/)** | Team | Player | Updated 1/11/26 – [2026 Update Page](https://nbadraftroom.com/2026-nba-mock-draft-update/) | Comp. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Pacers** | **[Darryn Peterson](https://nbadraftroom.com/darryn-peterson/)** | **[SG](https://nbadraftroom.com/shooting-guards/) – Kansas – HT: 6-5 – WT: 195 – WING: 6-10 1/2 – Fr**– Peterson has been back in action, although still somewhat limited by an upper leg injury. He looks a bit slow and not yet fully back to top form but he’s still incredibly dynamic with the ball in his hands and can score the ball at will. He’s a lethal shooter who has the talent to be one of the top scorers in the NBA before too long. 🏥 | almost Kobe |
| **2** | **Kings** | [**AJ Dybantsa**](https://nbadraftroom.com/aj-dybantsa/) | **[SF](https://nbadraftroom.com/small-forwards/) – BYU – HT: 6-9 – WT: 210 – WING: 7-0 – Fr**– AJ has been a playing like a man possessed and has been an absolute terror on the court these past few weeks. He does have some flaws or areas to work on but it’s scary to see a player his size with such awesome quickness, agility and ability to attack the paint. After a somewhat underwhelming summer AJ is back to looking like an elite prospect who has a real shot to go no.1 overall. 🔥 | jumbo-sized RJ Barrett, Tracy McGrady |
| **3** | **Hawks (** Pelicans **)** | **[Cameron Boozer](https://nbadraftroom.com/cameron-boozer/)** | **[PF](https://nbadraftroom.com/power-forwards/) – Duke – HT: 6-9 – WT: 250 – WING: 7-0 – Fr**– Cameron is an efficient offensive talent and one of the most polished big men prospects to come along in years. He’s a high feel player with a very advanced skill-set but there are concerns about his lack of burst and lack of ability to separate from defenders. He’s going to be a star at the next level but it remains to be seen if he has a superstar ceiling or is more of a great second-star on a good team. | Michael Beasley, Al Horford |
| **4** | **Wizards** | **[Caleb Wilson](https://nbadraftroom.com/caleb-wilson/)** | **[PF](https://nbadraftroom.com/power-forwards/) – North Carolina – HT: 6-9 – WT: 205 – WING: 6-11 – Fr**– A long, springy forward who is oozing with upside potential. Has a nice mid range game and a quick first step to get to the rim. Needs to get stronger and figure out the finer points of the game but has tools you can’t teach. He’s a versatile defender with the ability to guard up and down the line-up. He’s off to a monster start to begin his college career and is looking like an elite prospect who could even break into the top 3. | Kevin Garnett, Shareef Abdur-Rahim |
| **5** | **Nets** | **[Kingston Flemings](https://nbadraftroom.com/kingston-flemings/)** | **[PG](https://nbadraftroom.com/point-guards/) – Houston – HT: 6-3 – WT: 190 – WING: NA – Fr**– A well built and athletic point guard who excels at getting to the hoop. Has explosive ability and can really play above the rim and is also a high level shooter. | Brandon Knight++ |

Has deep range on his jumper and lets it fly with confidence. He’s had some bumps along the road early in his college career but I’m still a full believer in his. talents. | Tyrese Haliburton |
| **7** | **Mavs** | **[Braylon Mullins](https://nbadraftroom.com/braylon-mullins/)** | **[SG](https://nbadraftroom.com/shooting-guards/) – UConn – HT: 6-5 – WT: 196 – WING: NA – Fr**– One of the best outside shooters in his class with a clear NBA level jumper. Could be a one and done or maybe a two-year player for coach Hurley. Is a great mover off the ball and is always hunting his shot. | Buddy Hield+, Kevin Huerter, Klay |
| **8** | **Hornets** | **[Labaron Philon](https://nbadraftroom.com/labaron-philon/)** | **[PG](https://nbadraftroom.com/point-guards/) – Alabama – HT: 6-3 – WT: 175 – WING: 6-6 1/4 – So**– A gamer and a winner who just knows how to play and brings a lot of intensity. A rangy and wiry athlete with decent size but will have to add strength. Excels at getting to the cup and has great touch around the rim and a creative layup package. Plays with great poise and looks to be in total control on the court. | Tyrese Maxey, Monta Ellis+ |
| **9** | **Thunder (** Clippers **)** | **[Neoklis Avdalas](https://nbadraftroom.com/neoklis-avdalas/)** | **[SF](https://nbadraftroom.com/small-forwards/) – Virginia Tech (Greece) – HT: 6-9 – WT: 215 – WING: NA – Int.06** – A big guard/wing with a nice offensive package.

A big time shot maker with range on his jumper and a lot of confidence in his game. | Coby White, Stephon Marbury |

Keaton has become the primary play-maker and facilitator for a very good Illinois team, showing poise beyond his years and a ton of natural talent. ⬆️🔥 | taller Ryan Rollins |
| **12** | **Bulls** | **[Yaxel Lendeborg](https://nbadraftroom.com/yaxel-lendeborg/)** | **[PF](https://nbadraftroom.com/power-forwards/) – Michigan – HT: 6-9 – WT: 235 – WING: 7-4** **– Sr** -Yaxel is an absolute stud who can do a bit of everything on the court. He’s an older prospect but is still fairly young in terms of basketball experience and his rate of improvement has been awesome. He just keeps getting better and better and rounding out his game. | Kyle Kuzma, Obi Toppin+ |
| **13** | **Spurs (** Hawks **)** | **[Henry Veesaar](https://nbadraftroom.com/henry-veesaar/)** | **[C](https://nbadraftroom.com/centers/) – North Carolina (Estonia) – HT: 7-0 – WT: 225 – WING: NA – Jr**– A glue-guy center who does all the dirty work, rebounds and defends well and can also step out and hit the outside shot. A high energy player who seems to be everywhere on the court. ⬆️🔥 | Chris Anderson++ |
| **14** | **Blazers** | **[Jayden Quaintance](https://nbadraftroom.com/jayden-quaintance/)** | **[C](https://nbadraftroom.com/centers/) – Kentucky – HT: 6-10 – WT: 230 – WING: 7-4 – So** – JQ is an elite defensive talent with great strength, length, versatility and awesome defensive instincts. He’s a very pedestrian offensive player, limited to scoring around the rim, which limits his upside. | Tristan Thompson, Jalen Duren |
| **15** | **Heat** | **[Hannes Steinbach](https://nbadraftroom.com/hannes-steinback/)** | **[PF](https://nbadraftroom.com/power-forwards/) – Washington (Germany) – HT: 6-11 – WT: 248 – WING: 7-0 3/4 – Int.06**– A versatile big forward with good athleticism and movement skills.

He’s a rock solid player who has a NBA frame and does a lot of things well but he doesn’t stretch the floor and has limitations on the offensive end. | Jarace Walker+ |
| **17** | **Warriors** | **[Cameron Carr](https://nbadraftroom.com/cameron-carr/)** | **[SG](https://nbadraftroom.com/shooting-guards/) – Baylor – HT: 6-5 – WT: 175 – WING: 7-2 – So**– A long, lanky guard with a picture-perfect jumper and great above the rim ability.

Can really shoot the ball from deep and has an uncanny ability to get to the mid range.

| **[1](https://nbadraftroom.com/2026-nba-mock-draft/)-2** | Team | Player | Updated 1/11/26 | Comp. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **31** | **Pacers** | **[Isaiah Evans](https://nbadraftroom.com/isaiah-evans/)** | **[SF](https://nbadraftroom.com/small-forwards/) – Duke – 6-7 – WT: 175 – WING: NA – So**– Evans has great shooting touch and shot that is near impossible to block thanks to his length and size. He’s skinny and needs to continue to bulk up and he could take some time before being NBA ready. ⬇️ | Jett Howard |
| **32** | **Wizards** | **[Joshua Jefferson](https://nbadraftroom.com/joshua-jefferson/)** | **[PF](https://nbadraftroom.com/power-forwards/) – Iowa State – HT: 6-9 – WT: 240 – WING: NA** **– Sr** – A big bodied forward who plays an impressive all-around game and is one of the best players in college basketball. | – |
| **33** | **Pelicans** | **[JT Toppin](https://nbadraftroom.com/jt-toppin/)** | **[PF](https://nbadraftroom.com/power-forwards/) – Texas Tech – HT: 6-9 – WT: 210 – WING: NA – Jr** – Toppin is a workhorse on the block and is a steady, consistent and fundamentally sound player. He’s not likely to be a star but does his work well and is the type of player who can contribute to winning basketball. A very good rebounder who does all the dirty work and isn’t afraid to mix it up in the paint. | Taj Gibson, Carl Landry |
| **34** | **Nets** | **[Tyler Tanner](https://nbadraftroom.com/tyler-tanner/)** | **[PG](https://nbadraftroom.com/point-guards/) – Vanderbilt – HT: 6-0 – WT: 173 – WING: NA – So** – One of the best small guards in the country and a big time talent who plays bigger than his size. Is lightning quick and super dynamic with the ball in his hands. If he was 2 inches taller he’d be a lottery pick. 🔥🔥 | – |
| **35** | **Mavs** | **[Keyshawn Hall](https://nbadraftroom.com/keyshawn-hall/)** | **[SF](https://nbadraftroom.com/small-forwards/) – Auburn – 6-7 – WT: 240 – WING: NA – Sr**– A hard-working combo forward with excellent strength, athleticism and ability to stretch the floor. | – |
